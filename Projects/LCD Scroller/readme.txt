The LCD Scroller demo didn't make it into the book, but that's just because I forgot. It's 
good code and allows you to scroll a message on the LCD by using Brays terminal and 
inputting MSG followed by the message: as in MSGHELLO WORLD and a carriage return and the 
message displays. Now I know that C Programming books usually start out witht he Hello World
 program, but not only did we not start with it, we didn't evern finish with it unless 
you just happen to stumble across this file. Good Luck and keep an eye out for my next book.
